README for Barcode::Code128 - Generate CODE 128 bar codes

DESCRIPTION:
    Barcode::Code128 generates bar codes using the CODE 128 symbology.
    The typical use this is for generating a GIF file with the `gif()'
    method which uses the GD package by Lincoln Stein.  When this GIF
    file is printed, it can be scanned by most modern hand-held bar
    code readers.  The application which drove the invention of this
    module places the GIF file on a web page which the user must print
    out and submit along with supporting documents.  The bar code
    helps the receiving agency record when it has been received.

    Since the GD module is required you will need to install it before
    installing this module.  You can obtain it from the CPAN
    (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) repository of your choice
    under the directory `authors/id/LDS'.  Visit http://www.perl.com/
    for more information about CPAN.  The GD home page is:

EXAMPLE:
    use Barcode::Code128;
    $object = new Barcode::Code128;
    print "Content-Type: image/gif\n\n";
    $object->gif('CODE 128');
